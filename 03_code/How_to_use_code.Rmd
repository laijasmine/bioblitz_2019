## Basic usage
1. open the code template for the data you want to work with `consolidtaing_data_<type>.R`:
* **1file** - for if you are only processing one xlsx file
* **1folder** - dealing with one class and read all xlsx files inside the folder
* **allfolders** - multiple classes and days and read all the files across all folders *- does not work with files in the 02_data because all the columns are different*

2. update the variables at the top
For example:
```{r}
#change some variables
verified_date <- "03/17/2020"
file <- "./02_data/2020Mar10_DE_algaeinventory.xlsx"
blank_template <- "./00_templates/2020Mar01_UBCAlgae ENVR200 BioBlitz_template.xlsx"
name_of_results_file <- "04_results/2019_bioblitz_verified_volunteers.csv"
```

3. Run the code!
if you have rstudio installed
- select everything in the file `ctrl + a`
- go to the upper right and click run

4. Check the output in the 04_results folder
